        <h1>Lab 01: Responsive Design</h1>
        <h2>Initial Boot</h2>
        <p>
          First we start on the Workout page, however, using the buttons on the
          navbar below OR by swiping gestures left and right, we can navigate
          through pages. Here we can add a temporary profile picture by clicking
          the profile icon on the top right, along with other features. A timer
          has started for 5 minutes, and will activate if the user does no
          meaningful actions. All it does is plays an audio file to get users
          motivated.
        </p>
        <h2>Adding an Exercise</h2>
        <img src="images/addexercise.jpg" width="400" height="600" />
        <p>
          Navigate to the exercise page (furthest to the right), and select the
          + button in the top right to access the create problems page. Once
          here, you can enter the details of an exercise, where you then get the
          option to save it in firebase (with the firebase button), view
          firebase exercises for inspiration or locally save your exercise,
          along with a description and difficulty.
        </p>

        <h2>Adding Routines</h2>
        <p>
          As you can see, the exercise should now be added after pressing save
          and it can be seen on the Exercise page. Now we have an exercise, we
          can start using routines. Every day is allocated a routine for that
          day, and you can allocate an exercise to a day once per exercise. This
          means you could have push-ups on monday and tuesday, but not twice on
          monday.
        </p>
        <p>
          Navigate to the routine page, and press the edit button in the top
          right corner. Here in the routine page we select the Exercise we want
          to add, and the day we want to add it to. We can also set the Reps and
          Sets here, though the default value within is determined by the
          default values within the settings menu. After doing this, we can
          press save to save the exercise, and done when we want to leave the
          page.
        </p>

        <h2>Deleting Routines and Exercises</h2>
        <img src="images/deletedexercise.png" width="995" height="420" />
        <p>
          After adding routines and exercises, we should see ListViews on their
          respective pages. If you want to delete an Routine, this is done in
          the edit routine activity we used before, just tap the exercise you
          want to remove from your routine and it will disappear just like
          magic. Removing an exercise is very similar. Navigate to the exercise
          page and just tap the exercise you want to remove. Upon removing an
          exercise, the respective exercise will also be removed from any
          routines it exists in.
        </p>

        <h2>Beginning Workout:</h2>
        <p>
          If you navigate to the workout page, it will show the routine for
          today and today alone (as set in the routine page), upon pressing
          begin, you have the option to skip each workout, or do them and press
          done. A score is calculated based on the exercise difficulty, the
          amount of reps and the amount of sets. If you skip an exercise, you
          dont get any points. Upon finishing your workout, you will get to a
          page where you it will be stacked up against your highscore and tell
          you if you've beaten it or not. You also have the option to share your
          current score with another user (over text or whatever you want). If
          you have beaten your high score, it is overwritten and your new score
          becomes your highscore to beat.
        </p>

        <h2>Temporary Profile Picture:</h2>
        <p>
          Like many people, I've always dreamed of a tiny version of me watching
          me while I workout, and while that isnt possible until cloning becomes
          a thing, this is the closest we are going to get anytime soon. Tap the
          profile picture button in the top left of any of the main pages, grant
          permissions and set a temporary profile picture so it at least looks
          like someone cares.
        </p>

        <h2>Finding Nearby Gyms:</h2>
        <img src="images/nearbygym.png" width="1010" height="300" />
        <p>
          Now, while apps are great for keeping you fit, gyms are arguably even
          better. For that reason, I have added a convenient button in the top
          right menu, that will show you a list of gyms nearby
